Ruruku is a manual test coordinator. Its goal is to make it easier for developers,
teams, QA folks and robots to coordinate their testing efforts.

We think that testcase descriptions should live next to your code - in Ruruku the testplan is just a YAML file.
When the time has come to go through the tests, submit your testplan to a Ruruku instance and start testing.
Every tester (man or machine) can claim test cases, contribute their results and watch for updates.

Ruruku is built for integration: sporting a simple web UI for human testers, a command-line interface for robots
and a gRPC API for machines, Ruruku can talk to anyone.
